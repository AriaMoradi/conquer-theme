# Conquer theme remade
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a recreation of the conquer theme by free-css.com.
I aim to not use bootstrap and recreate it as close as possible.
 
You can find the original theme at [here](https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page196/conquer/).
